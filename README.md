# markov-chains-differential-expression-analysis

Project Description
This repository demonstrates advanced statistical modeling techniques applied to healthcare data and genomic expression analysis. It showcases two complementary analyses:

1) Markov Chain Modeling of Patient Health Trajectories: Implementation of stochastic models to simulate patient transitions between health states (Healthy, Sick, Hospitalized, and Dead) over time. This analysis quantifies expected durations in each state and explores how initial conditions affect long-term health outcomes.

2) Differential Gene Expression Analysis of Tumor vs. Normal Tissue: Application of robust statistical methods to identify significantly differentially expressed genes between paired tumor and normal tissue samples. This includes quality control procedures, outlier detection, and evaluation of covariates that influence expression patterns.

Technical Skills Demonstrated

Stochastic modeling using Markov chains
RNA-seq data preprocessing and quality control
Poisson regression for count data
Covariate analysis in gene expression studies
Visualization of complex biological data
Statistical hypothesis testing with multiple comparison correction
R programming for biological data analysis

This project highlights the application of statistical methods to understand both macro-level patient trajectories and molecular-level gene expression changes, demonstrating proficiency in computational biology and biostatistics.
